body:

This talk will discuss the ins and outs of Numba, a library for accelerating Python and NumPy code. Numba allows Python users to achieve performance approaching those of lower-level languages (like C) by lightly annotating their existing Python functions. We'll cover how/when to use Numba and discuss the basics of how Numba's internals work.
