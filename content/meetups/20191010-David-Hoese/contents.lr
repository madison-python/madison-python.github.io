This talk will go over the pros and cons of various data file formats common in scientific python workflows. We'll cover various concerns when storing data on-disk and how popular formats address these challenges. The file formats covered will include CSV, flat binary, HDF5, NetCDF4, Parquet/Arrow, and Zarr.

Materials from this talk can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/djhoese/data-file-formats) and a live version of the notebook presented is available [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/djhoese/data-file-formats/master?urlpath=lab/tree/data_files.ipynb).
