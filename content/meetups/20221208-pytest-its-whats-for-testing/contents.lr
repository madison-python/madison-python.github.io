pytest is the premier Python testing framework. It scales smoothly from small imperative tests all the way to huge test suites powered by metaprogramming, while maintaining a clean, DRY style. In this talk, we'll do a whirlwind, example-heavy tour of pytest's "killer features": assertion rewriting, fixtures, parameterization, hooks, and plugins.

Josh earned his PhD in physics at UW-Madison and was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Morgridge Institute facilitating research computing at enormous scale through the Center for High Throughput Computing.
