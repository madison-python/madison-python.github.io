With the release of models such as BERT, ChatGPT and DALL-E-2, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models have captured the world's imagination. While many NLP models are open-sourced, integrating these models into an end-product remains challenging in many cases. In this talk, Adam will show how the popular Python web framework FastAPI can be used to make cutting-edge NLP models available to end-users in a fast and standards-based way. While the use-case in this talk revolves around machine learning, the benefits of FastAPI extend into many other fields; no prior knowledge of ML required!
