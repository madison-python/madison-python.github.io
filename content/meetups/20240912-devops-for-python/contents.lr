Software isn’t just developed; it is operated.

DevOps is a philosophy combining development and operations in a tight loop to shorten the software development lifecycle.  This September, David will introduce some tools and design practices to make python software deployments more manageable, faster, and easier.  Starting with a Python script that performs a useful function, we’ll webify it, containerize it, put it in the cloud, and monitor its health.

David Webber, PhD, is co-founder and chief scientist of Scanalytics, Inc.  Founded in 2013, Scanalytics makes smart pressure-sensitive flooring underlayment to understand real-time occupancy and movement within physical spaces, with applications including building energy efficiency and security.
