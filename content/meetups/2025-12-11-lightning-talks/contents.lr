We’re gathering at the Downtown Madison Public Library for a fast-paced night of Python ideas and community conversation. We’ve got a full lineup of talks from local members, covering everything from tiny hardware to big-picture tech culture:

* “Python on Microcontrollers” — David Webber
* “Reject techno-feudalism with omg.lol 😜” — Eric Staats
* “Replicating the Magic™ of the Cloud in Your Basement” — Wesley Hershberger
* MadPy Community Environment Survey Discussion — David Hoese

If you haven’t responded to the community environment survey yet, it’s still open—we’d love your input before the meetup. The results will help kick off a group discussion about the tools, workflows, and day-to-day realities of our local Python community.

Whether you’re a longtime member or totally new, Lightning Talk nights are one of the best ways to reconnect, learn something unexpected, and meet friendly developers in a relaxed and welcoming setting.

All are welcome. Bring a friend. We’d love to see you there!
