The Madison Python meetup group is hosting a social gathering at Blue Moon Bar & Grill on University Ave. We won't have a speaker or slides. Just friendly conversation. Whether you're an experienced software developer, someone interested to learn about the field, or just looking to meet new people, please join us!
