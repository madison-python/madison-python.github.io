<p>Madison Python (MadPy) and Women in Tech (WiT) are hosting a joint meetup. Join us at the downtown branch of the library for a social with food and beverages provided. We won't have a speaker or slides. Just friendly conversation. This event is open to all gender identities, including men, women, and non-binary folks. Newcomers welcome.</p>
<p>The library will host us on the 3rd floor until 8:45pm. After, attendees are invited to make their way over to Coopers Tavern.</p>

<p>Feel free to arrive anytime between 6:30pm and 7pm to grab some pizza and a drink and get settled in. We'll begin discussion at 7pm; we have the room reserved until 8:30pm.</p>
<p>Afterwards, anyone interested is welcome to continue socializing with the group at Cooper's Tavern (which has multiple non-alcoholic drinks available).</p>
